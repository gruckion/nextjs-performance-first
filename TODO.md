# TODO

- [x] Add [nextjs-bundle-analysis](https://github.com/hashicorp/nextjs-bundle-analysis) to the PR CI process
- [x] Fix ESLint error: Cannot find package '@eslint/js' in packages/eslint-config
- [ ] Configure Next.js build caching for faster CI builds
- [ ] Fix cache path validation error in GitHub Actions workflow
- [ ] Setup [CodeCov](https://app.codecov.io/)
- [ ] Setup LightHouseCI diff based on Vercels LightHouse CI reports, using [this](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/lighthouse-compare) and [this](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/vercel-preview-url-lighthouse-audit). We want the diff which I doubt the Vercel one does.
- [x] Disable NextJS telemetry
